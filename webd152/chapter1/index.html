<h2>Brown sugar Pearl Black Tea Latte</h2>
<p>My favorite drink is the Brown sugar Pearl Black Tea Latte from Yifang. The flavor of the drink is the right balance of sugar and 
  just enough milk so as not to cover up the flavors from the black tea. The boba pearls are cooked to the perfect texture and are 
  freshly made. This is my all-time favorite go-to drink especially during the exam season to cramp those all-nighters. The price of 
  the drink is pretty high and you could get it at other boba places for a bit lower price but I feel the quality of the drink is a 
  bit compromised. I tried to make this drink with ingredients at home which takes a bit of time but worth the effort especially if 
  you have a crowd because its difficult to make in small batches and storing it lose the texture of the boba pearls.</p>
